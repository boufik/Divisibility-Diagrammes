# Divisibility-Diagrammes
We scan all the numbers from 2 to 1000 and examine how many divisors they have. After this, we calculate the divisibility = n / divisors(n) and plot 2 diagrammes. The last diagramme has a straight line as its bound. This happens because the divisibility of  aprime 'n' is n/2, because divisors(n) = 2 for primes.
